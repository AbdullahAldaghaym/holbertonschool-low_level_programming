# Hello World in C

This project introduces the basics of C programming, including compilation, main function, and basic output functions.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why C programming is important
- Learn about the history and creators of C
- Master the C compilation process with gcc
- Use printf, puts, and putchar for output
- Understand the main function and program structure
- Follow Betty coding style guidelines

## Key Concepts

### The Compilation Process
- Preprocessing → Compilation → Assembly → Linking
- Using `gcc main.c` compiles and creates `a.out` by default

### Main Function
- Entry point of every C program
- Return value indicates program success (0) or failure

### Output Functions
- `printf` - Formatted output with placeholders
- `puts` - Simple string output with automatic newline
- `putchar` - Single character output

## Requirements

- All code must compile with `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Follow Betty coding style
- No errors or warnings during compilation
- Proper use of header files

## Tools

- **gcc** - GNU C Compiler
- **betty-style** - Code style checker
- **betty-doc** - Documentation checker
