# Singly Linked Lists Project


This project covers implementation and manipulation of **singly linked lists** in C. You will learn how nodes work, how memory is dynamically allocated for linked structures, and how to traverse and free linked lists.


---


## 📘 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:


- When and why to use **linked lists vs arrays**
- How to **build**, **traverse**, and **free** linked lists
- How to properly allocate and manage memory
- How to avoid memory leaks
