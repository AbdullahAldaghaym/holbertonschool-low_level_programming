# Function Pointers Project

This project explores function pointers in C programming, demonstrating how to use pointers to functions for dynamic behavior and callback mechanisms.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

### General
- Understand what function pointers are and how to use them
- Know what a function pointer exactly holds
- Understand where a function pointer points to in the virtual memory
- Master using function pointers for dynamic dispatch and callbacks
