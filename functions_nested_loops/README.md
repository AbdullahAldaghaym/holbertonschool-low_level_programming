# C Programming - Functions, Nested Loops

This repository contains C programming projects focused on functions, nested loops, and header files.

## Learning Objectives

By completing these projects, you will be able to explain:

- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- The difference between function declaration and definition
- What is a function prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are header files and how to use them with #include
- The purpose of GCC flags: -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89

## Projects

### Functions & Nested Loops Series
- **0-putchar.c** - Prints "_putchar" using the _putchar function
- **main.h** - Header file containing function prototypes

## Requirements

- All files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows Betty style guidelines
- No errors or warnings during compilation
- No use of standard library functions (printf, puts, etc.)
- Use of _putchar function provided by Holberton
- No global variables
- Maximum of 5 functions per file
- Header file (main.h) with all function prototypes

## Compilation
