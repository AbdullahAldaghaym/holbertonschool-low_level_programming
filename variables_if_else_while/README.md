# C Programming - Variables, If, Else, While

This repository contains C programming projects focused on fundamental concepts including variables, conditional statements, and loops.

## Learning Objectives

By completing these projects, you will be able to explain:

- Arithmetic, logical, and relational operators in C
- TRUE and FALSE values in C (0 = FALSE, non-zero = TRUE)
- How to use `if`, `if...else` statements
- How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to assign values to variables and print them with `printf`
- How to use `while` loops with variables
- The ASCII character set
- The purpose of GCC flags `-m32` and `-m64`

## Projects

### Hello World Series
- **4-puts.c** - Prints a string using `puts()`
- **5-printf.c** - Prints a string using `printf()`
- **6-size.c** - Prints the sizes of various data types

### Variables, If, Else, While Series
- **0-positive_or_negative.c** - Determines if a random number is positive, negative, or zero

- All files end with a new line
- Code follows Betty style guidelines
- No errors or warnings during compilation
- No use of the `system` function
