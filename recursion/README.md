# Recursion Project

This project explores the concept of recursion in C programming through various exercises that demonstrate how functions can call themselves to solve problems.

## üìÅ Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-puts_recursion.c` | Prints a string followed by a new line using recursion |
| `1-print_rev_recursion.c` | Prints a string in reverse using recursion |
| `2-strlen_recursion.c` | Returns the length of a string using recursion |
| `3-factorial.c` | Calculates the factorial of a number using recursion |
| `4-pow_recursion.c` | Calculates x raised to the power of y using recursion |
| `5-sqrt_recursion.c` | Finds the natural square root of a number using recursion |
| `6-is_prime_number.c` | Checks if a number is prime using recursion |
| `100-is_palindrome.c` | Checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion |
| `101-wildcmp.c` | Compares two strings with wildcard pattern matching |
| `main.h` | Header file containing all function prototypes |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |
